# 365AutomatedLab

This module will create a Microsoft 365 Test Environment using an excel workbook

## Project Summary

I started this module to create a test environment for 365 as there wasn't one for groups, only users which Microsoft provides. I highly recommend using their environment, and use this module with it so you are truly using this in a test environment. Please do not use this module in your production environment until tested in your test environment.
