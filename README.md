# 365AutomatedLab

This module will create a Microsoft 365 Test Environment using an excel workbook

## Project Summary

I started this module to create a test environment for 365 as there wasn't one for groups, only users which Microsoft provides in there [365 Developer Program Environment](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) . I was tired of having to come up with test user names, their information, and groups each time, or remembering which ones I had already created every time I wanted to do some testing. Let's be honest. we aren't in our test environment every day and all day. 

Please do not use this module in your production environment until tested in your test environment. I highly recommend using Microsoft's 365 Developer Program Environment, and use this module with it so you are truly using this in a test environment. It is free to you, and it renewed every 90 days.
